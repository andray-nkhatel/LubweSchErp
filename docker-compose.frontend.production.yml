# Frontend production: serve a pre-built dist with nginx (no build on the server).
#
# API URL is set in SchoolERPSMSClient/.env.production (http://104.248.222.220:8080/api).
#
# Workflow:
#   1. Build the frontend once (locally or in CI). .env.production is used automatically:
#        cd SchoolERPSMSClient
#        npm ci
#        npm run build
#   2. From repo root, build the image (only copies dist, no npm on the server):
#        docker compose -f docker-compose.frontend.production.yml build
#   3. Run:
#        docker compose -f docker-compose.frontend.production.yml up -d
#
# Use this on a VPS to avoid the long npm install + vite build on weak hardware.
